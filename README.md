# Fast Forward algorithm for solving AI planning problems based on Planning Graphs

### Introduction

This is an implementation of Forward search algorithm using Planning Graphs for solving AI Planning problems.
For more information about the problem and the implemented algorithm see the following papers:  
	[The FF Planning System: Fast Plan Generation Through Heuristic Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.0675.pdf)  
	[Fast Planning Through Planning Graph Analysis](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/Papers/graphplan.pdf)

The code is written in Visual C#. So in order to run the code you need a C# compiler and .net framework or you can simply use Microsoft Visual Studio.

### Instructions

The program takes a simplified PDDL format file as input. A PDDL parser is included which you can use to convert any PDDL format file to the simplified PDDL.
After running the program browse for the “Domain” file and the “Problem” file and press run to see the result.
